HackGT project.

Hardware built using Intel Edison and servos, fitted into a styrofoam body created by us.
Code written for the Intel Edison board to create a physical music visualizer.
We split live music into three frequency bins and then actuate the servos to stretch and shrink rubber bands to model
graphical visualizers using physical rubber bands.
